# Description
generate.py creates a rom.bin file that can be used by ROM programmers to load ROMs described in Ben Eater's 8-bit breadboard computer project with the necessary binary data used to drive the display.

Ben used an arduino to program the ROM but given that I had a programmer from his other 6502 kit (TL866ii), I decided to take a short-cut.
